To use these templates, players can either:
1. Roll randomly for each category
2. Pick the most appropriate options for their situation
3. Mix and match between templates to create new combinations

The key is to sound confident and use at least 3-4 technical terms in each solution attempt! The templates now include a wide variety of away team equipment and specialized tools commonly used in Star Trek away missions.
