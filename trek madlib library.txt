I'll create three "mad-lib" style technobabble templates that players can use to generate solutions during montage tests or problem-solving scenarios.



# Star Trek Solution Generator Templates

## Template 1: Basic Technical Solution
"If we [ACTION VERB] the [SHIP SYSTEM] to emit a [PARTICLE TYPE] [EMISSION TYPE], we should be able to [DESIRED RESULT]."

ACTION VERB:
- Modify
- Reconfigure
- Reroute
- Initialize
- Calibrate

SHIP SYSTEM:
- Deflector dish
- Main sensors
- Shield generators
- EPS conduits
- Warp core

PARTICLE TYPE:
- Tachyon
- Verteron
- Chronoton
- Tetryon
- Graviton

EMISSION TYPE:
- Pulse
- Beam
- Field
- Wave
- Burst

DESIRED RESULT:
- Penetrate their shields
- Break through the interference
- Detect their ships
- Disrupt their weapons
- Establish communication

Example: "If we modify the deflector dish to emit a tachyon pulse, we should be able to penetrate their shields."

## Template 2: Emergency Response
"We could [CREATE ACTION] a [TECHNICAL NOUN] [LOCATION] by [TECHNICAL ACTION] the [SYSTEM] through the [SECONDARY SYSTEM]!"

CREATE ACTION:
- Generate
- Create
- Establish
- Project
- Initialize

TECHNICAL NOUN:
- Feedback
- Resonance
- Containment
- Interference
- Dampening

LOCATION:
- Matrix
- Field
- Grid
- Array
- Network

TECHNICAL ACTION:
- Routing
- Channeling
- Cycling
- Looping
- Cascading

SYSTEM:
- Primary power
- Shield harmonics
- Sensor array
- Computer core
- Phaser banks

SECONDARY SYSTEM:
- Auxiliary processors
- Secondary buffers
- Backup generators
- Emergency systems
- Reserve power cells

Example: "We could generate a feedback matrix by routing the primary power through the auxiliary processors!"

## Template 3: Complex Solution
"By [TECHNICAL PROCESS] a [MODIFYING WORD] [ENERGY TYPE] [PATTERN] using the [PRIMARY TOOL], we might be able to [ACTION VERB] their [TARGET SYSTEM] with a [MODIFIER] [EMISSION TYPE]!"

TECHNICAL PROCESS:
- Initializing
- Configuring
- Implementing
- Modulating
- Programming

MODIFYING WORD:
- Rotating
- Cascading
- Inverse
- Phased
- Recursive

ENERGY TYPE:
- Subspace
- Quantum
- Temporal
- Warp
- Plasma

PATTERN:
- Algorithm
- Sequence
- Protocol
- Pattern
- Format

PRIMARY TOOL:
- Main computer
- Sensor array
- Shield matrix
- Deflector array
- Warp core

ACTION VERB:
- Disrupt
- Override
- Bypass
- Neutralize
- Deactivate

TARGET SYSTEM:
- Weapons
- Shields
- Sensors
- Communications
- Propulsion

MODIFIER:
- Focused
- Concentrated
- Amplified
- Enhanced
- Synchronized

EMISSION TYPE:
- Burst
- Pulse
- Beam
- Wave
- Field

Example: "By initializing a rotating subspace algorithm using the main computer, we might be able to disrupt their weapons with a focused burst!"

To use these templates, players can either:
1. Roll randomly for each category
2. Pick the most appropriate options for their situation
3. Mix and match between templates to create new combinations

The key is to sound confident and use at least 3-4 technical terms in each solution attempt!
